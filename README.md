### [Zo Computer](https://zocomputer.com)

Zo is an intelligent cloud computer that lets you turn your ideas into reality fast. You can store your files, connect your tools, and then research or build practically anything with AI. 

Because Zo is a server, you can host anything – your projects, a Plex media server, self-hosted n8n, you name it. You can even text or email your Zo – turning your cloud computer into a personal assistant.

You can access your Zo from any web browser, using our desktop apps for Mac and Windows, or using our iOS app (coming soon).

All users get 100GB of free storage, access to frontier AI models, and hosting built-in.
